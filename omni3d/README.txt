Original description:

If you've found a mesh file that you wish you could use in your project but your viewer/engine can't read it, or even if you want to port old mesh file formats to use in your project, this software is for you.
omni3d will try to support both new/popular and old/less-popular file formats and features.

Of course, this project didn't even get close to completion.
