Kenbak-1 is, according to the Boston Computer Museum of 1987, the
first commercially available personal computer. It's a fully
programmable, serial stored program, general purpose digital computer
that uses 256 bytes ( as 8-bits ) of RAM! Wow, that's quite large... :-P
It was built by John Blankenbaker, and initial sales commenced in
September of 1971. If you want to dig in more detail, visit:

When you firstly run the emulator, the output may look strange. Remember
that the DiLa Series outputs only what that PC would output, in this case
the seven LEDs. All LEDs must be off, because the PC is powered off. This
is a list of mapped buttons:
    Power On/Off   :    P
    
    Data Button 7  :    Q
    Data Button 6  :    W
    Data Button 5  :    E
    Data Button 4  :    R
    Data Button 3  :    T
    Data Button 2  :    Y
    Data Button 1  :    U
    Data Button 0  :    I
    
    Clear Button   :    A
    Display Button :    S
    Set Button     :    D
    Read Button    :    F
    Store Button   :    G
    Start Button   :    H
    Stop Button    :    J
    
Please note that the prototype of that PC is emulated, that is why there is
no "lock/unlock memory" switch.

It is adviced that you start using Kenbak-1 along with John Blankenbaker's
document which is full of exercises written for better/easier understanding
of the computer. You can find it at:
    <http://www.kenbak-1.net/index_files/Lab%20Exer.pdf>

Performance:
    If your PC is faster than 80's cellphones, the emulator will run in real time.
