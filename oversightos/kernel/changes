Changes:
    Now if "alloc" fails to allocate the requested amount, the previously
    allocated amount remains usable.

    Added commands for rebooting and powering off ( reboot, shutdown ).

    Added PCI device enumeration. The amount of detected devices is printed.

Bug fixes:
    Fixed a silly bug that caused quadruple memory usage of "alloc".

    Fixed a bug that caused all months after July to not print properly, also crashed the OS on December.
